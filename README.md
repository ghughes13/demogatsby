Gatsby Demo site we create in https://youtu.be/LABMfg35CBs to pull in blogs from wordpress.

What's different from a fresh Gatsby site? 
*gatsby-source-wordpress is installed
Added:
- gatsby-config.js
- gatsby-node.js
- templates/BlogPost.js

To connect to your wordpress site, switch out the "baseURL" in gatsby-config.js"
